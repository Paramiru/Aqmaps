## Getting Started

These subsections will help you get a copy of the project and understand how to run it on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### How to Install

The first thing you should do is clone this repository into your local machine. You can do this with the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/Paramiru/ILP-2
```

Once you have cloned the repository you should check your current version of Java. Recall I used Java 11 (LTS) for the project. You can check the version you are currently using running this command in the terminal.

```
java --version
```
You do not have to worry about the dependencies since they are in the file pom.xml which you can find inside the aqmaps directory. Maven will take care of downloading anything you do not currently have so that you can run the project.
